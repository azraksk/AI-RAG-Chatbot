      "['A neural network is a neural circuit of biological neurons, sometimes also called a biological neural network, or a network of artificial neurons or nodes in the case of an artificial neural network.Artificial neural networks are used for solving artificial intelligence AI problems; they model connections of biological neurons as weights between nodes. A positive weight reflects an excitatory connection, while negative values mean inhibitory connections. All inputs are modified by a weight and summed. This activity is referred to as a linear combination. Finally, an activation function controls the amplitude of the output. For example, an acceptable range of output is usually between 0 and 1, or it could be −1 and 1.These artificial networks may be used for predictive modeling, adaptive control and applications where they can be trained via a dataset. Self-learning resulting from experience can occur within networks, which can derive conclusions from a complex and seemingly unrelated set of information.', 'Declarative logic programming languageDatalog is a declarative logic programming language.  While it is syntactically a subset of Prolog, Datalog generally uses a bottom-up rather than top-down evaluation model.  This difference yields significantly different behavior and properties from Prolog.  It is often used as a query language for deductive databases. Datalog has been applied to problems in data integration, networking, program analysis, and more.', 'Data science is an interdisciplinary academic field that uses statistics, scientific computing, scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract or extrapolate knowledge and insights from noisy, structured, and unstructured data.Data science also integrates domain knowledge from the underlying application domain e.g., natural sciences, information technology, and medicine. Data science is multifaceted and can be described as a science, a research paradigm, a research method, a discipline, a workflow, and a profession.Data science is a \"concept to unify statistics, data analysis, informatics, and their related methods\" to \"understand and analyze actual phenomena\" with data. It uses techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the context of mathematics, statistics, computer science, information science, and domain knowledge. However, data science is different from computer science and information science. Turing Award winner Jim Gray imagined data science as a \"fourth paradigm\" of science empirical, theoretical, computational, and now data-driven and asserted that \"everything about science is changing because of the impact of information technology\" and the data deluge.A  data scientist is a professional who creates programming code and combines it with statistical knowledge to create insights from data.']\n",
